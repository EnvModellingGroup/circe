circe
=======

A modelling template for the EMRG thetis models.

Circe is a Greek goddess, daughter of sun god Helios and Perse, 
one of the three thousand Oceanid nymphs. She lived on an 
island, Aeaea, and was an enchantress. Around her home prowl 
strangely docile lions and wolves. She lures any who land on 
the island to her home with her lovely singing while weaving 
on an enormous loom, but later drugs them so that they change shape.

However, this model is set up to run tidal, storm or tsunami
simulations. To get started you'll need some data and a mesh.

The input folder contains all input files; bathymetry, mesh, etc

The data folder contains any other data needed for your
model, including tidal gauges, for example

The sims folder contain all your model simulations.

the scripts folder contains a bunch of generic processing
and analysis scripts.
